## About

ImgReveal is a simple Qt based GUI application written using PySide.  

It allows you two view two images layered ontop of each other and use a slider to adjust how much of the image on top is visible at any time.  This allows a different approach to side by side comparisons or before and after shots

## Requirements

1. Qt
2. PySide


## How to run

The python script takes the two image names as arguments to the command line, to run is simply

python imgreveal.py "path-to-image-one" "path-to-image-two"
